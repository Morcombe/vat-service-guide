# VAT (MTD) End-to-End Service Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how you can integrate your software with our APIs to submit VAT returns using the Making Tax Digital process.

It shows how the APIs fit into various end-to-end user journeys.

It is aimed at product owners, business analysts, architects and developers.

## Background and context

The following resources provide some background to the service:

  * [Making Tax Digital Vision](#) (TBS)
  * [VAT (MTD) high level design](#) (TBS)

## Benefits

Keeping VAT records digitally and providing updates to us at HMRC direct from the software will reduce the amount of avoidable errors which businesses currently make and the cost, uncertainty and worry they face when we are forced to intervene to put things right.

This streamlined digital experience will integrate tax into day-to-day business record keeping, giving them confidence that they have got it right and provide them with a view of their tax position throughout the year.

## End-to-end user journeys

These journeys show examples of use. They are not exhaustive and are not meant to be prescriptive.
Journeys for businesses and agents are broken down into:

  * VAT set up activities
  * retrieving VAT obligations, submitting returns and paying bills
  * paying VAT penalties and interest - or appealing
  * VAT close down activities

## Roadmap

The [VAT (MTD) roadmap](https://hmrc-devhub-cycle-33.herokuapp.com/documentation/docs/vat-roadmap) explains how the VAT API endpoints will be rolled out to create the final API service that software developers can integrate with.
