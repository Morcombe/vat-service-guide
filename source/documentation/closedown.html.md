# Closedown

Agent to client relationships can come to an end or agents can go out of business.

## Unsubscribe client from VAT (MTD)

Initially there is a manual process in place whereby a business or agent can contact our HMRC helpline to notify us they wish to unsubscribe from the service.

In the event that the business continues to be VAT registered, if necessary VAT returns can be submitted manually.

In time the manual process will be replaced by a digital process.


## Client breaks link

### Client only de-authorisation

1. Client signs in to Government Gateway account
2. Client manages their tax agents
3. Client removes authorisation from an agency
4. Client confirms removal of authorisation from that agency

### Agent breaks client link

This process will be provided by the agentâ€™s Agent Services account.


## Change details
This will initially be the usual process, which can be used to remove the agent reference number and Government Gateway enrolment (HMRC-AS-AGENTS).

The scenario where this is needed is when an agency ceases trading.

If an agency no longer wants to participate in MTD, they can stop using their Government Gateway ID. We are currently working to include a digital journey as part of the wider change of circumstances solution.
