## Read guidance

Businesses and agents can learn about VAT (MTD) by reading guidance on GOV.UK. In particular:

* [Making Tax Digital: how VAT businesses and other VAT entities can get ready](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital-how-vat-businesses-and-other-vat-entities-can-get-ready)
* [Use software to submit your VAT Returns](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-software-to-submit-your-vat-returns) - guidance for businesses, including variuous links to get started
* [Agents: use software to submit VAT Returns](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/agents-use-software-to-submit-vat-returns) - guidance for agents, including various links to get started

We encourage you to include links to the relevant guidance in your software.

## Create an agent services account

To access VAT (MTD), an agent must create an agent services account. This is a one-off process.

<img src="figures/create-agent-services-account.png" alt="Create an agent services account process diagram" border="1px"; style="width:520px;" />

<a href="figures/create-agent-services-account.png" target="blank">Open the create an agent services account process diagram in a new tab</a>.

1. Agent signs in to Government Gateway account with existing agent credentials
2. Agent identifies their business with its SA UTR or CTR and associated postcode
3. Agent gives some further details and chooses a password
4. HMRC creates a new Government Gateway account for the agent, and gives them their User ID
5. Agent checks details
6. HMRC creates the agent services account, and gives the agent their agent services account reference number

This service is available on GOV.UK at [www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-hmrc-agent-services-account](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-hmrc-agent-services-account). We encourage you to include this link in your software.

## Link existing VAT clients

After an agent creates an agent services account, they link their existing VAT clients to the account.

3. Agent signs in to their existing Government Gateway account

## Link a new VAT client

After an agent creates an agent services account, they must link any new clients to the account one by one.

<img src="figures/agent-links-new-vat.png" alt="Link a new VAT client process diagram" border="1px"; style="width:520px;" />

5. Client receives email from agent and clicks on the link to begin the process
6. Client logs in with Government Gateway account and completes identity checks
7. Client confirms authorisation for agent to represent them

This service is available on GOV.UK at [www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-hmrc-agent-services-account](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-hmrc-agent-services-account). We encourage you to include this link in your software.

## Subscribe to VAT

Post April 2019 we will deliver a VAT Subscription (formerly known as VAT Registration) service that will allow businesses new to VAT to subscribe at the same time as they sign up to MTD.

Until this service is delivered, new businesses will need to subscribe to VAT using the existing service, then navigate to the sign up service and complete that journey. The service will request information about the business and the person running it. Following
successful subscription the business will be informed of their VAT Return deadlines.

Agents must already be subscribed to HMRC agent services in order to access the new VAT subscription service on behalf of their clients.

## Agent signs up client for VAT (MTD)

Once an agent has linked a client to their agent services account, they can sign them up for VAT (MTD).

<img src="figures/agents-sign-up.png" alt="Agent signs up client for VAT (MTD) process diagram" border="1px"; style="width:520px;" />

<a href="figures/agents-sign-up.png" target="blank">Open the agent signs up client for VAT (MTD) process diagram in a new tab</a>.

1. Agent signs in to agent services account
2. Agent gives client's details, including VRN, business type and other type-specific details
3. Agent gives and verifies their own email address (once only)
4. Agent signs up client to receive secure messages
5. Agent gives client's email address to HMRC
6. Client receives verification email and verifies their email address
7. Agent agrees to terms of participation for self and client
8. Agent waits 72 hours to see if client is approved to sign up

We will develop supporting content that allows a business to identify whether they need to:

  * register for VAT and then sign up for VAT (MTD)
  * sign up for VAT (MTD) only

This service is available on GOV.UK at [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/agents-use-software-to-submit-vat-returns](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/agents-use-software-to-submit-vat-returns). We encourage you to include this link in your software.

## Business signs up for VAT (MTD)

Businesses can sign themselves up for VAT (MTD) whether or not they use an agent. They must sign up before first use, even if they have already signed up for VAT (MTD) for Income Tax.

6. Business agrees to receive emails and gives and verifies its email address

## Choose software

We provide a list of [software applications that are VAT (MTD) compatible](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-for-sending-income-tax-updates#VAT) so businesses and agents can choose the right software for their needs.

This video is about the compatible software that businesses and agents must use as part of VAT (MTD).

<br>

Your application must comply with our [terms of use](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/terms-of-use). You must accept the terms of use before we issue your application's production credentials.

## Link software to HMRC

Businesses and agents using software that connects to the VAT (MTD) API must grant authority to the software to interact with HMRC on their behalf. We use the open standard [OAuth 2.0 (opens in a new tab)](https://oauth.net/2/), which involves the business or agent signing in via their Governmant Gateway account and following the HMRC authorisation journey.

<img src="figures/links-software.png" alt="Link software to HMRC process diagram" border="1px"; style="width:320px;" />

<a href="figures/links-software.png" target="blank">Open the link software to HMRC process diagram in a new tab</a>.

1. Your software sends the business or the agent to the authorisation endpoint
2. Business or agent views grant authority start page for an overview of the process before starting
3. Business or agent signs in to their Government Gateway account
4. Business or agent registers for or completes 2-step verification as applicable
5. Business or agent completes identity checks if applicable
6. Business or agent grants (or refuses) authority for the software to interact with HMRC on their behalf
7. Business or agent is returned to your software

Business and agents authenticate directly with us using their Government Gateway account, and grant the software the authority to interact with HMRC on their behalf. They grant this for a set of functions called API scopes which are required for [each VAT (MTD) endpoint](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/vat-api/1.0#resources).

In the case of agents, they must sign in to their Government Gateway account with the user ID and password for their agent services account, which was generated as part of the [agent services account journey](set-up.html#create-an-agent-services-account).

We then issue an OAuth 2.0 access token to the software which is specific to the business or agent. The software must pass this access token in subsequent API requests as explained in authorisation of [user-restricted endpoints](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/user-restricted-endpoints).
