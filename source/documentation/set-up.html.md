# Set up

Before **agents** can represent clients they must set up their relationships and software.

1. [Agent creates an agent services account](#create-an-agent-services-account)
2. [Agent links existing VAT clients](#link-existing-vat-clients)
3. [Agent links a new VAT client](#link-a-new-vat-client)
4. [Agent registers a client for VAT (MTD)](#agent-registers-a-client-for-vat-mtd)
5. [Agent chooses software](#choose-software)
6. [Agent links software to HMRC](#link-software-to-hmrc)

Before **businesses** can submit VAT returns, they must register for VAT and set up their software.

1. [Business registers for VAT (MTD)](#business-registers-for-vat-mtd)
2. [Business chooses software](#choose-software)
3. [Business links software to HMRC](#link-software-to-hmrc)

## Agent or business reads guidance

Your software should include a link to the [guidance to help agents and businesses](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital-how-vat-businesses-and-other-vat-entities-can-get-ready) understand how to register themselves and their clients for VAT.

## Create an agent services account

An agent must create an agent services account and connect it to their accounting software. Account creation is a one-off process which enables an agency to access VAT (MTD) and act for their clients.

The agent does this through their accounting software or from GOV.UK. The agent must:

  * create a new Government Gateway ID which will be the agency’s new Government Gateway ID and password. This will become the agency's user ID and password which is to access all our new HMRC services via accounting software
  * give information about the agency, which is held by us
  * receive an agent reference number, which is the number assigned to all their existing and new clients

### To create an agent services account:

1. Agent creates a new Government Gateway ID which becomes the agency's new Government Gateway ID and password.
2. Agent signs in to Government Gateway account with existing agent credentials
3. Agent identifies their agency with its SA UTR or CTR
4. Agent gives their details and email address
5. Agent saves user ID and gateway agent ID
6. Agent gives agency address
7. Agent checks details and creates account
8. Agent saves agent services account number

For Partnerships or a Limited Liability Partnerships you will need to use your Partnership UTR, and not the UTR for each partner or LL partner.

## Link existing VAT clients

After an agent creates an agent services account, they link their existing VAT clients to the account. Once a client subscribes to VAT (MTD), the agent can:

  * view the client's data
  * submit updates on their behalf to us at HMRC

### To link existing VAT clients:

1. Agent starts journey to add existing clients
2. Agent signs in to Government Gateway account with agent credentials for existing clients
3. Agent enters agency account number and their SA UTR or CTR
4. Connection to existing clients is confirmed for that Government Gateway account
5. Agent repeats the process with next Government Gateway account that has existing clients until all clients are linked

To link existing VAT clients to their agent services account the agent must:

  * sign in with each existing Government Gateway ID that is currently used to access HMRC online services. For example, if an agent currently has ten Government Gateway IDs they must do this ten times.
  * submit their agency's SA or CT UTR and agent reference number. This links existing VAT clients linked to a particular Government Gateway ID to the new Agent services account.

We encourage software developers to ensure their agency users are aware of the service and give links to more information.

## Link a new VAT client

After an agent creates an agent services account, they must get authority from each new client they want to represent. To do this an agent must send an email request to each new client. The client can accept or decline the request digitally.

### To link a new VAT client:

1. Agent signs into agent services account</li>
2. Agent clicks on link to ask a client to authorise them</li>
3. Agent chooses individual or organisation client type</li>
4. Agent chooses what authorisation they need from client</li>
5. Agent gives client's VRN and VAT registration date</li>
6. Agent gets a unique link and sends it to their client in email</li>
7. Client receives email from agent and clicks on the link to begin the process</li>
8. Client logs in with Government Gateway account and completes identity checks</li>
9. Client confirms authorisation for agent to represent them
10. Agent receives the client's VAT data

## Agent registers a client for VAT (MTD)

Agents can sign up an existing client’s business. However, the creation of the agent services account which is a one-off process must be completed before an agency can sign up their clients for VAT MTD.

### To register a client for VAT (MTD):

1. Agent signs in to Government Gateway account
2. Agent confirms VRN of client
3. Agent confirms client is sole trader or limited company
4. Agent confirms client details eg NINO/DOB for sole trader, CRN for limited company
5. Agent confirms client's email address
6. Client verifies their email address
7. Agent agrees to terms of participation for self and client
8. Agent waits 24 hours to see if client is approved to sign up

We will develop supporting content that allows a business to identify whether they need to:

  * register for tax and then sign up for MTD
  * sign up only

After a business signs up they are informed of their updated obligations.

The sign-up service requests minimal information from the business such as e-mail address. It reuses information provided as part of identity checking.

We will enable businesses or agents to register and sign up through GOV.UK. Software developers can also link to the service from their software.

> Note: The link to ‘Choose accounting software’ on the sign-up confirmation page will remain inactive until VAT (MTD) leaves Controlled Go Live.

## Business registers for VAT (MTD)

Sole traders and limited companies can sign up for VAT MTD. They must sign up before first use, even if they have already signed up for MTD for income tax.

### To register a business for VAT (MTD):

1. Business signs in to Government Gateway account
2. Business confirms VRN
3. Business confirms whether it is sole trader or limited company
4. Business completes identity verification (if applicable)
5. If a Limited company, confirms its Company Registration Number
6. Business enters and verifies its email address
7. Business agrees to the terms of participation
8. Business waits 24 hours to see if it is approved to sign up

> Note: The link to ‘Choose accounting software’ on the sign-up confirmation page will remain inactive until VAT (MTD) leaves Controlled Go Live.

## Choose software

Here is a list of [software applications that are VAT (MTD) compatible](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-for-sending-income-tax-updates) so businesses and agents can choose the right software for their needs.

This video is about the compatible software that businesses and agents must use as part of VAT MTD.

<br>

We require that each application offered  to users complies with our [Terms of Use](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/terms-of-use) which must be accepted by software developers before we issue production credentials.

## Link software to HMRC

Businesses and agents using software that connects to the VAT (MTD) API must give their software permission to interact with their data and HMRC.

### To link software to HMRC:

1. Third party software sends the business or the agent to the authorisation endpoint
2. Business or agent views grant authority start page for an overview of the process before starting
3. Business or agent signs in to their Government Gateway account
4. Business or agent registers for or completes 2 step verification as applicable
5. Business or agent completes identity checks if applicable
6. Business or agent grants (or refuses) permission for the software to represent them with HMRC
5. Business or agent is returned to third party software

Business and agents authenticate directly with us using their Government Gateway account, and grant the software the authority to interact with HMRC on their behalf. They grant this for a set of functions called API scopes which are required for [each VAT (MTD) endpoint](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/vat-api/1.0#resources).

In the case of agents, they must sign in to their Government Gateway account with the user ID and password for their agent services account, which was generated as part of the [agent services account journey](set-up.html#create-an-agent-services-account).

We then issue an OAuth 2.0 access token to the software which is specific to the business or agent. The software must pass this access token in subsequent API requests as explained in authorisation of [user-restricted endpoints](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/user-restricted-endpoints).
